<div align="left">These series are intended to measure the number of Americans traveling internationally and the number of foreign visitors admitted to the United States for a temporary period of time for purposes of business or pleasure.  These travelers are also known as nonimmigrants.  In order to achieve this coverage, the series on American travelers attempted to exclude U.S. citizens residing abroad, cruise travelers, and crewmen, as well as military personnel and other government employees and their dependents stationed abroad.  The series on foreign visitors excluded immigrants, transmigrants, migratory labor from Canada and Mexico, government personnel, and foreign businessmen employed in the United States.  Before 1985, the series cover only overseas travelers, and thus exclude travel over international land borders to and from Canada and Mexico, and travel between the coterminous United States and Alaska, Hawai'i, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.</div>
		
<div align="left">
<b>Series Dh319&ndash;320</b>.  The series on ocean-bound tourists for 1820&ndash;1900 were compiled by Douglass North and Matthew Simon in order to allow estimation of the value of tourist expenditures included in the balance of payments.  This required estimates of the number of tourists abroad during the year, which was not necessarily the number of tourists who departed that year.  They estimated the stock of U.S. tourists abroad by inflating the number of U.S. citizens returning in each year to account for those who may have remained abroad.  To estimate ocean-bound foreign tourists in the United States, they adjusted the total number of passengers arriving to account for those who were immigrants to the United States, transmigrants (primarily to Canada and the West Indies), and Canadian and Mexican tourists and farm laborers.  The figures are intended to measure overseas travelers but, before 1885, may include some number of visitors arriving from Canada, the West Indies, and Mexico.  For 1820&ndash;1860, the figures were obtained by dividing North's estimate of tourist expenditures by the per capita figures he reported of $750 for American tourists and $1,000 for foreign tourists.</div>
		
<div align="left">
<b>Series Dh321&ndash;322</b>.  Arrivals from the British North American possessions and Mexico were not included after July 1, 1885.  Prior to that date they were included if they arrived by ship.  Statistics on passenger travel were obtained from passenger manifests or lists required by law to be prepared by carriers for vessels and aircraft traveling between the United States and foreign countries.  Arrival manifests were first required under the Act of 1819, and similar manifests of departing passengers were first required under the Act of 1907.  Prior to 1908, statistical information on passenger travel is incomplete.  From 1820 through 1855, reports showed the number of U.S. citizens and the total number of alien passengers arrived.  During the years 1856&ndash;1890, data reflected the arrivals of U.S. citizens returning, immigrants, and nonimmigrant aliens.  Data relating to the inward and outward movement of passengers became complete in 1908, when, as the result of the Act of 1907, departure records were first compiled.</div>
		
<div align="left">
<b>Series Dh322</b>.  Excludes travel over international land borders, crewmen, military personnel, and travelers between the United States and its outlying areas.</div>
		
<div align="left">
<b>Series Dh323</b>.  Excludes the following: travel to Canada and Mexico; travel between the coterminous United States and Alaska, Hawai'i, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands; cruise travelers; military personnel and other government employees and their dependents stationed abroad; and U.S. citizens residing abroad.</div>
		
<div align="left">
<b>Series Dh325</b>.  The data on foreign visitors for 1919&ndash;1932 include all classes of nonimmigrants except aliens returning to the United States to resume residence after a temporary stay abroad of less than one year.  The data on foreign visitors for 1933&ndash;1970 include only nonimmigrant aliens admitted as temporary visitors for business or pleasure, foreigners in transit through the United States, and students.</div>
